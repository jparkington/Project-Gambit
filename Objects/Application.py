'''
To-do:
- Add a method to Dagger.py that finds the top three user_positions with centipawn velocity and collects their indeces
- Update Dagger to use Parser class and existing Parquet directory for games using the Utility class
- Update Navigator to use three game buttons
- Add a centipawn plot to the bottom of Navigator's tkinter canvas
- Update Navigator to use the results from Dagger (e.g. game 1's 5 moves, game 2's 5 moves, game 3's 5 moves)
- Add a home button to navigator (with a clever icon--maybe a pawn) that takes you back to your game at the given index
